# CS-300-DSA-System-Analysis-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

I was tasked with creating a Course information program for a fictional University that would gather information about the course and display desired information. Specifically, we were tasked with reading values from a CSV file, loading the information into a program, sorting and displaying this data in the most efficient way possible.  I was responsible from writing pseudocode and presenting that to the school and then developing the program following approval.  

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

There are a handful of data structures that developers must know but each have their own strengths and weaknesses.  It is important to sit and think about what the problem is and what the outcome should be. Since the information was being loaded into the program and the requirements stated that the data should be sorted and organized based off certain criteria (such as course number and prerequisites), I began to think about which data structures I should use to maximize efficiency.  There are several scenarios to consider such as size and scale.  It was stated that the list needed to be sorted that ruled out certain structures.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Watching numerous C++ tutorial videos and referencing Big O cheat sheet to compare and contrast data structure strength and weaknesses.  

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

It really goes to show that the requirements are so important and really should be followed to have a functional product.  Once one gets out of the introductory stages of development, we start to see how software needs to be developed with best practices and standards.
